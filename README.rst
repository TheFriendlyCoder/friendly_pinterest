Overview
=============

User friendly Python wrapper for the
`Pinterest developer APIs <https://developers.pinterest.com/>`_.
This project is currently in very early development, with only a bare minimum
of functionality, intended for some of my personal projects. I'm sharing it here
in case someone finds the implementation helpful for their projects. Also, if
anyone would like to contribute to this pet project feel free to fork it and
send me pull requests for any changes you may like.

Comments, suggestions and bugs may be reported to the project
`maintainer <mailto:kevin@thefriendlycoder.com>`_

Full API documentation can be found on
`ReadTheDocs.org <http://friendlypins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Development Environment
=======================

In order to make use of this library, you will need a private access token
to use when instantiating the main api class. This token authenticates you
as a specific Pinterest user, giving access to that users' profile, boards
and pins. Typically this token would be generated by an application, but for
testing purposes you can manually generate a token as described below. These
steps are loosley based on the steps described on the
`Developer API <https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/overview/>`_
under the "Postman" app section.
