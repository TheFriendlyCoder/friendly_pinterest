Overview
========

User friendly Python wrapper for the
`Pinterest developer APIs <https://developers.pinterest.com/>`_.
This project is currently in very early development, with only a bare minimum
of functionality, intended for some of my personal projects. I'm sharing it here
in case someone finds the implementation helpful for their projects. Also, if
anyone would like to contribute to this pet project feel free to fork it and
send me pull requests for any changes you may like.

Comments, suggestions and bugs may be reported to the project
`maintainer <mailto:kevin@thefriendlycoder.com>`_
